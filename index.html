        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Evan from class 26/14! I’m always up for trying new food and exploring different places. I love discovering unique flavors and expanding my culinary horizons, whether it's local street food or dishes from around the world. When I’m not on a food adventure, you can usually find me exploring new spots, whether it's a hidden café, a scenic park, or an unfamiliar neighborhood. Life is all about new experiences, and I’m always looking for the next exciting place or tasty dish to try!</p>

        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>Having been in Robotics in secondary school, my interest in technology started to grow stronger. I believe that in the future, there would be many opportunities for technology to help improve our quality of life. By taking H2 Computing, I hope to be able to build a good foundation of knowledge in Computing and be able to explore more into AI and robotics in the process.</p>
